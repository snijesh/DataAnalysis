**Title**: Effect of 5a-dihydrotestosterone on breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453


**Summary**: Analysis of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells treated with the androgen 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 6h, 16h and 48h to define the genes that are differentially regulated in response to DHT.
 	
**Overall design**: MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were treated with 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for time course, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, in order to obtain the gene expression profiles at three time points. The vehicle treated samples are used as control.

**Title**: Molecular changes in premenopausal estrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancer after oophorectomy<br>

**Summary**: For premenopausal women with primary ER+ breast cancer, oophorectomy (OvX) is an evidence-based cost-effective option and is standard treatment in many countries. However, there is virtually no data describing the effects of OvX on breast tumour biology. We therefore characterized the endocrine and genome-wide transcriptional impact of OvX in 56 premenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer for two weeks prior to mastectomy. Plasma estradiol concentrations decreased from 421±305 to 24.1±24.5 pmol/l (mean±sd) 24 hours after OvX and to 8.8±7.3pmol/l two weeks later at mastectomy. Ki67 decreased in 33/36 (91.7%) tumours. The expression of 655 genes changed significantly (FDR<1%) with an absolute mean fold-change (FC) ≥1.25 (257 up, 398 down). Archetypal oestrogen-regulated genes, proliferation-associated genes and putative progesterone-regulated genes were strongly down-regulated. The gene expression changes did not differ according to HER2 status and correlated strongly with those after aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment in 81 postmenopausal women. However, after OvX the mean FC was significantly higher compared to AI. In conclusion, changes in tumoural gene expression after OvX were largely similar but of a greater magnitude to those observed after AI in postmenopausal patients but OvX appeared to have a greater effect on progesterone-regulated genes than AI.<br>
 	
**Overall design**: A non-randomized phase II trial of neoadjuvant OvX was conducted in 56 premenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer in Vietnam in order to identify the most important genes and pathways associated with the response to OvX as well as determinants of that response. In addition, the degree to which the relationships differed from those observed after an AI in postmenopausal women (i.e. comparing withdrawal of oestrogen and progesterone vs. withdrawal of oestrogen alone) was assessed. Global gene expression profiles from ERα-positive breast carcinomas before and after OvX treatment were compared. Transcripts responding differently to OvX and estrogen deprivation were identified and integrated using Gene Ontology and pathway analyses. This represents the data for OvX only.

Please note that 88 paired frozen samples from 32 patients (out of 56 in the trial; 24 with A, B & C samples; 5 with A & C and 3 with B & C) were used for Illumina whole genome expression BeadChips analysis.

**Title**: ZR-75-1 microarray expression data<br>

**Summary**: Testing the hormonal response of ZR-75-1 cells to estrogen, androgens, and a combination of both homones, with view determining the crosstalk between the transcriptional programs mediated by these hormones in breast cancer cells, and comparison with matched ChIP sequencing data for AR and ERalpha.<br>
Data analysis demonstrated reciprocal interference between 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)- and estradiol (E2)-induced transcriptional programs. Specifically, regulation of 26% of E2 and 15% of DHT target genes was significantly affected by cotreatment with the other hormone, in the majority of cases (78-83%) antagonistically. Pathway analysis suggested that DHT co-treatment, for example, depleted E2-regulted pathways in cell survival and proliferation.<br>
 	
**Overall design**: Total RNA was extractd from luminal-like breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells in quadruplicate after treatment for 16h with 10nM of E2, DHT or E2+DHT.<br>
